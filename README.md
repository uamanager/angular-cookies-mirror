**Useful for `cordova` applications where cookies are not allowed**

The `cookiesMirror` module provides you to use cookies even if they are restricted in browser or platform.
Module is tracking all cookies that you specified from responses header `Set-cookie`, keep them in `localStorage` and sends in every request via `Cookie` header.  


## Install

You can install this package with `bower`.

### bower

```shell
bower install angular-cookies-mirror
```

Add a `<script>` to your `index.html`:

```html
<script src="/bower_components/angular-cookies-mirror/angular-cookies-mirror.js"></script>
```

Then add `cookiesMirror` as a dependency for your app:

```javascript
(function(){
    angular.
        module('myApp', ['cookiesMirror']);
})();
```
## Usage

Add to provider config cookies name those you want to keep:
 
```javascript
(function(){
    angular.
        module('myApp').
        config(cookiesMirrorConfig);
    
    cookiesMirrorConfig.$inject = ['$cookiesMirrorProvider'];
    
    function cookiesMirrorConfig($cookiesMirrorProvider){
        $cookiesMirrorProvider.track(['cookieName1', 'cookieName2']);

        //you can use it also in this way: 
        $cookiesMirrorProvider.track('cookieName');
        
        //or like this:
        $cookiesMirrorProvider.track('cookieName1', 'cookieName2');
    }
